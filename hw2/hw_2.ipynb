Si    milarly, matrix vector multiplication is $O(n^2)$, since matrix vector multi    plication can be viewed as computing $n$ inner products. The computational c    ost for inverting a matrix in $\\mathbb R^n$ is $O(n^3)$, and consequently, t    he cost grows rapidly as the set of equations grows in size. This is why the     expression $A^{-1}b$ is usually not computed by directly inverting the matr    ix $A$. Instead, the $QR$ decomposition of $A$ is exploited to decrease the     computational cost.\n"
