\item Let $x,y\in\Real{n}$ be two unit-norm vectors, that is, such that $\|x\|_2 = \|y\|_2=1$. Show algebraically that the vectors $x-y$ and $x+y$ are orthogonal. Then, show this graphically by drawing the two vectors on the 2D plane, as well as any other necessary shapes. You may use right angles, circles and straight lines to make your point.
