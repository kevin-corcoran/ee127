\item Show that for any non-zero vector $x$,
\[
\text{card} (x) \ge \frac{\|x\|_1^2}{\|x\|_2^2},
\]
where $\text{card} (x)$ is the \emph{cardinality} of the vector $x$, defined as the number of non-zero elements in $x$. Find all vectors $x$ for which the lower bound is attained.

\textit{Hint:} Try using Cauchy-Schwarz like in the previous part.
