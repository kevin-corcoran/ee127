\qns{Level Sets}\\

Plot/hand-draw the level sets of the following functions.

Also draw the gradient directions in the level-set diagram. 
Additionally, compute the first and second order Taylor series approximation around the point $(1,1)$ for each function and comment on how accurately they approximate the true function. 

\begin{enumerate}
\input{level_sets/1}

\sol{\input{level_sets_solutions/1}}

\input{level_sets/2}

\sol{\input{level_sets_solutions/2}}
\end{enumerate}
