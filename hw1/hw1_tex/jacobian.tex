\qns{Jacobians}\\
The \textit{Jacobian} of a vector-valued function $g \::\: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \Real{m}$ is the $m \times n$ matrix, denoted as $D g$, containing the derivatives of components of $g$ with respect to the variables:
\[
(Dg)_{ij} = \frac{\partial g_i}{\partial x_j}, \;\; i = 1, \ldots, m, \;\; j = 1, \ldots, n.
\]

In class, we will also be using the Jacobian frequently.
